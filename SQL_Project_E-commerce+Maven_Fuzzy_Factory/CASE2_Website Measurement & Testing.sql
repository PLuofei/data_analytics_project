all entry pages and rank them on entry volume, that would be great.

Request 3 from Morgan Rockwell (Website Manager) June 14, 2012
The other day you showed us that all of our traffic is landing on the homepage right now. We should check how that landing page is 
performing. Can you pull bounce rates for traffic landing on the homepage? I would like to see three  numbers…Sessions, Bounced 
Sessions, and % of Sessions which Bounced (aka “Bounce Rate”).

Request 4 from Morgan Rockwell (Website Manager) July 28, 2012
Based on your bounce rate analysis, we ran a new custom landing page (/lander-1) in a 50/50 test against the homepage (/home) for 
our gsearch nonbrand traffic. Can you pull bounce rates for the two groups so we can evaluate the new page? Make sure to just look 
at the time period where /lander-1 was getting traffic, so that it is a fair comparison.

I’d like to understand where we lose our gsearch visitors between the new /lander-1 page and placing an order. Can you build us a 
full conversion funnel, analyzing how many customers make it to each step? Start with /lander-1 and build the funnel all the way to 
ourthank you page. Please use data since August 5th.

We tested an updated billing page based on your funnel analysis. Can you take a look and see whether /billing-2 is doing any better 
than the original /billing page? We’re wondering what % of sessions on those pages end up placing an order. FYI – we ran this test 
for all traffic, not just for our search visitors.
